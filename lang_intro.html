                There are numerous programming languages, and they can be categorized in various ways based
                on their characteristics and purposes. Here are some common categories:
            </p>
            <ol>

                        <li>
                            High-Level Languages: Closer to human languages, easier to write and understand.
                            Examples include Python, Java, and JavaScript.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Low-Level Languages: Closer to machine code, more difficult for humans to read and write.
                            Examples include Assembly and machine code.
                        </li>

                         behavior. Examples include Java, C++, and Python.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Functional Languages: Treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.
                         Examples include Haskell and Lisp.

                Programming languages and scripting languages are both used for writing computer programs. <br> But
                there are some key differences between them:

                            <li>
                                Programming languages are typically compiled, which means that the source code is translated
                                into machine code before the program is executed. This process results in an executable file that
                                can run independently.
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                Scripting languages are generally interpreted, which means that the source code is executed line
                                by line by an interpreter. There is no separate compilation step, and the code is not translated into
                                machine code.
                            </li>

                                Programming languages often use static typing, where variable types are explicitly declared and
                                checked at compile time. This can help catch type-related errors early.
                            </li>

                                Scripting languages often use dynamic typing, where variable types are determined at runtime.
                                This provides more flexibility but can lead to runtime errors if type mismatches occur.

                                and large-scale software projects where performance and efficiency are critical.

                                Programming languages tend to be more verbose, requiring more code to accomplish tasks.
                                This can make them more suitable for large and complex projects.
                            </li>

                                Scripting languages are often less verbose, allowing developers to write code more quickly and
                                with fewer lines, which is beneficial for smaller tasks and prototypes.

                Scripting languages often don't produce a standalone executable. <br>
                The key distinction here is that programming languages involve a separate compilation step,
                resulting in an independent executable file, while scripting languages are interpreted, and the code
                is executed directly without creating a standalone executable. This difference affects the way you

                In summary, procedural programming focuses on procedures and functions that manipulate data,
                while OOP focuses on creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior. OOP promotes code
                organization around classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, making it well-suited for modeling
                complex real-world systems and enhancing code maintainability and reusability. Procedural
                programming is more straightforward and linear, often used for simpler tasks or when performance
                is a critical concern. The choice between the two depends on the specific needs of a project.

            In the procedural example, functions are separate from the data they work on, while in the object oriented example, 
            data and behavior are encapsulated within the class, promoting a more
            organized and self-contained structure. The OOP approach is beneficial when dealing with more
            complex systems with multiple related attributes and behaviors
