            <p>
                Programming languages and scripting languages are both used for writing computer programs, but
                there are some key differences between them:

                                Programming languages are typically compiled, which means that the source code is translated
                                into machine code before the program is executed. This process results in an executable file that
                                can run independently.

                                Scripting languages are generally interpreted, which means that the source code is executed line
                                by line by an interpreter. There is no separate compilation step, and the code is not translated into
                                machine code.

                                Programming languages often use static typing, where variable types are explicitly declared and
                                checked at compile time. This can help catch type-related errors early.

                                Scripting languages often use dynamic typing, where variable types are determined at runtime.
                                This provides more flexibility but can lead to runtime errors if type mismatches occur.

                It's worth noting that the line between programming and scripting languages can sometimes be
                blurred, and many languages have elements of both. The choice between them depends on the
                specific requirements of a project and personal preferences.
