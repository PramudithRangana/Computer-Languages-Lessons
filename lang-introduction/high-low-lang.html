            <h2>High-Level Programming Languages</h2>
        
            <h3>Definition and Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Explanation of high-level languages being closer to human language.</li>
                <li>Abstraction and automation of complex tasks.</li>
                Examples: 
                <ul>Python</ul>
                <ul>Java</ul>
                <ul>Ruby</ul>
                <ul>C#</ul>
                etc.
            </ul>

            <h3>Advantages</h3>
        
            <h4>Readability and Ease of Use:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax designed for human understanding.</li>
                <li>Reduces the chance of errors and enhances collaboration.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Portability:</h4>
            <p>Code written in high-level languages is usually portable across different platforms.</p>
        
            <h4>Productivity:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Faster development due to built-in libraries and higher-level abstractions.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Abstraction:</h4>
            <p>Hides low-level details, making it easier to focus on solving problems.</p>
        
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        
            <h4>Execution Speed:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Generally slower compared to low-level languages.</li>
                <li>Interpreter or compiler adds an extra layer of processing.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Resource Usage:</h4>
            <p>High-level languages may use more system resources.</p>
        
            <h4>Less Control:</h4>
            <p>Reduced control over system-level details.</p>

            <h2>Low-Level Programming Languages</h2>
        
            <h3>Definition and Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Explanation of low-level languages interacting more closely with hardware.</li>
                <li>Direct manipulation of computer hardware.</li>
                <li>Examples: Assembly language, machine code.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
        
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Execution Speed:</strong> Code is closer to machine language, leading to faster execution.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> More direct control over system resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Closer to Hardware:</strong> Useful for tasks that require specific hardware interactions.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Writing code at a low level is more complex and error-prone.</li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Code may not be easily portable across different systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Curve:</strong> Steeper learning curve due to dealing with hardware details.</li>
            </ol>
