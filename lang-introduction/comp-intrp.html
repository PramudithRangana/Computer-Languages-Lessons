            <h2>Compiled Languages</h2>
        
            <h3>Definition and Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Explanation of compiled languages being translated into machine code before execution.</li>
                <li>Examples: C, C++, Rust.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Compiler:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Source code is transformed into an executable file by a compiler.</li>
                        <li>Compilation is done before the program is run.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Execution Speed:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generally faster execution as the code is already in machine language.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Compiled code may be less portable, requiring recompilation for different platforms.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
        
            <h4>Performance:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Generally, better performance due to direct machine code execution.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Optimizations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Compilers can apply various optimizations during the compilation process.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Security:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Code is distributed in an already compiled form, making it harder to reverse engineer.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

            <h4>Portability:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Requires recompilation for different platforms.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Development Speed:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Longer development cycles due to the compilation step.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="interpr">
            <h2>Interpreted Languages</h2>

            <h3>Definition and Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Introduction to interpreted languages, where code is executed line by line.
                </li>
                    Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Concepts</h3>

            <h4>Interpreter:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Code is executed by an interpreter at runtime.
                    No separate compilation step.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Execution Speed:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Generally slower than compiled languages as interpretation occurs during runtime.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Portability:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Code is often more portable, as it can be run on any platform with the appropriate interpreter.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Advantages</h3>

            <h4>Portability:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Generally more portable, as the code can be distributed in its original form.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Development Speed:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Faster development cycles as there is no compilation step.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Debugging:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Easier debugging since errors are identified at runtime.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        
            <h4>Performance:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Generally slower execution speed due to interpretation overhead.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Security:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Code is distributed in source form, making it more accessible and easier to reverse engineer.
                </li>
            </ul>
