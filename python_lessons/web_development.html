            <h3>Introduction to Web Frameworks like Flask or Django</h3>

            <p>
                Web frameworks are essential tools for developing web applications.
                They provide a structured way to build web-based software by handling common tasks such as routing, request handling, templating, and
                database interactions. Two popular Python web frameworks are Flask and Django:

            <div class="web-frame">
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Flask:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Flask is a micro web framework that is lightweight and easy to learn.</li>
                            <li>It provides the essentials for web development, leaving room for developers to choose libraries and tools based on their project's needs.</li>
                            <li>Flask is well-suited for small to medium-sized web applications, RESTful APIs, and prototyping.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><span>Django:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Django is a high-level web framework that follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, offering a comprehensive set of features.</li>
                            <li>
                                It includes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, an admin panel, authentication, and other tools, making it ideal for large-scale
                                applications, content management systems (CMS), and e-commerce websites.
                            </li>

            <h3>Building a Simple Web Application:</h3>

            <p>
                Here, I'll provide an example of building a simple web application using Flask.
                This application will have a single route that displays "Hello, World!" when accessed.
                You'll need to have Flask installed, which you can do with : <br>
            </p>

            <div class="code-sec">
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        pip install Flask
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        from flask import Flask

                        app = Flask(__name)

                        # Define a route and the function to handle it
                        @app.route('/')
                        def hello_world():
                            return 'Hello, World!'

                        if __name__ == '__main__':
                            app.run()
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>

            <div class="act-flask">
                <ol>
                    <li>First, import Flask and create an instance of the <code>Flask</code> class.</li>
                    <li>Define a route using the <code>@app.route</code> decorator. In this case, the route is <code>'/'</code>, which represents the root URL of your web application.</li>
                    <li>Create a function that handles the route. This function returns the string "Hello, World!" to be displayed in the browser.</li>
                    <li>Finally, run the web application with <code>app.run()</code>.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <p>
                To run your Flask application, save the code in a Python file (e.g. <code>app.py</code>) and execute it.
                You'll see an output indicating that your application is running,
                and you can access it in your web browser by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:5000/" target="_blank"><span id="lcl-hst">http://localhost:5000/</span></a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a simple example, but Flask and Django provide extensive capabilities for building web applications, including handling forms,
                connecting to databases, managing sessions, and more. You can expand your web application by adding routes and functionality as needed.
