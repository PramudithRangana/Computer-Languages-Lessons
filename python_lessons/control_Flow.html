        <p>Control flow is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to create <a href="./decision-making.html" class="des-mk">decision-making</a> structures. 
            In Python, you can control the flow of your program using conditional statements. The most basic conditional statement is the "if statement."

                <h4>If Statements</h4>
    
                <p>
                    An "if statement" allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. <br>
                    If the condition is false, the block of code is skipped. The basic syntax of an "if statement" is as follows:
                </p>
                
                <div id="if-intro">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            # Code to execute when the condition is true
                            if condition:
                                # logic
                                pass
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
        
                <p>Here's an example of an "if statement" in action:</p>
    
                <div id="act-if">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            age = 25
                
                            if age >= 18:
                                print("You are an adult.")
                            
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
        
                <p>In this example, <br> the condition `age >= 18` is true (since `age` is 25), <br>
                    so the code block following the "if statement" is executed, and "You are an adult." is printed to the console.
                </p>
            </div>
    
            <div id="indent">
                <h4>Indentation</h4>
    
                <p>In Python, indentation is used to define code blocks. Indentation is essential for the proper functioning of "if statements." 
                    The code inside the "if" block must be indented to the same level, and it's typically indented with four spaces.
                </p>
    
                <div id="if-cond">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            if condition:
                                # This code is inside the if block
                                # It is indented with four spaces
            
                                print("Condition is true")
                            # This code is outside the if block
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div id="else-stm">
                <h4>Else Statements</h4>
    
                <p>You can extend the "if statement" with an "else statement" to provide an alternative code block to execute when the condition is false. 
                    The basic syntax is:
                </p>
    
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        if condition:
                            # Code to execute when the condition is true
                        else:
                            # Code to execute when the condition is false
                    </code>
                </pre>
    
                <p>Here's an example with an "if" and "else" statement:</p>
    
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        age = 15
    
                        if age >= 18:
                            print("You are an adult.")
                        else:
                            print("You are a minor.")
                    </code>
                </pre>
    
                <p>In this case, since the `age` is 15 (which is less than 18), the "if" block is skipped, and the "else" block is executed, printing "You are a minor."

                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="elif-stm">
                <h4>Elif Statements</h4>
    
                <p>You can handle multiple conditions using "elif" (short for "else if") statements. <br>
                    "Elif" allows you to test additional conditions after the initial "if" condition. Here's the syntax:
                </p>
    
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        if condition1:
                            # Code to execute when condition1 is true
                        elif condition2:
                            # Code to execute when condition2 is true
                        else:
                            # Code to execute when all conditions are false
                    </code>
                </pre>
    
                <p>Here's an example with "if," "elif," and "else" statements:</p>
    
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        temperature = 25
    
                        if temperature > 30:
                            print("It's hot outside.")
                        elif temperature > 20:
                            print("It's a pleasant day.")
                        else:
                            print("It's cool outside.")
                    </code>
                </pre>
    
                <p>In this example, the code inside the "elif" block is executed because the temperature (25) falls 
                    between the conditions of the "if" and "else" statements.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div id="nest-if-stm">
                <h4>Nested If Statements</h4>
    
                <p>You can nest "if statements" within other "if statements" to create more complex decision-making structures.</p>
        
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        x = 10
                        y = 5
        
                        if x > 5:
                            if y > 2:
                                print("Both conditions are true.")
                    </code>
                </pre>
        
                <p>In this example, <br> the inner "if" statement is only executed if the outer "if" condition is true and the inner "if" condition is also true.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Comparison Operators</h3>

                <p>When using "if statements," you often use comparison operators to compare values. Common comparison operators in Python include:</p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li>`==` (equal)</li>
                    <li>`!=` (not equal)</li>
                    <li>`>` (greater than)</li>
                    <li>`<` (less than)</li>
                    <li>`>=` (greater than or equal to)</li>
                    <li>`<=` (less than or equal to)</li>

                <p>
                    Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit-by-bit operation. Assume if a = 60; and 
                    b = 13; Now in binary format they will be as follows
                </p>

                <pre id="output-result">
                    a = 0011 1100

                    -----------------
                    a&b = 0000 1100
                    a|b = 0011 1101
                    a^b = 0011 0001

                <p>
                    Python's built-in function bin() can be used to obtain binary representation of an integer 
                    number.

                <p>
                    Operator precedence affects the evaluation of an an expression. <br>
                    For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because the operator * has 
                    higher precedence than +, so it first multiplies 3*2 and then is added to 7. <br>
                    Here, the operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with 
                    the lowest appear at the bottom.

                <p>
                    In general, statements are executed sequentially- The first statement in a function is 
                    executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need 
                    to execute a block of code several number of times.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Programming languages provide various control structures that allow more complicated 
                    execution paths.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. 
                    The following diagram illustrates a loop statement.

                <h3>For Loops:</h3>
                
                <p>A "for loop" is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects. 
                    The loop runs for each item in the sequence until there are no more items. The basic syntax of a "for loop" is as follows:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        for variable in iterable:
                            # Code to execute for each item in the iterable
                    </code>

                <p>Here's an example of a "for loop" that iterates over a list of numbers:</p>
        
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        
                        for number in numbers:
                            print(number)
                    </code>
                </pre>
        
                <p>In this example, the "for loop" iterates over the list "numbers" and prints each number.</p>
        
                <h5>Range Function</h5>
        
                <p>The `range()` function is often used with "for loops" to generate a sequence of numbers. <br>
                    It can be used to specify the number of iterations in a loop.
                </p>
        
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        for i in range(5):
                            print(i)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>In this case, the loop runs from 0 to 4, and the numbers are printed accordingly.</p>

                <p>
                    range() generates an iterator to progress integers starting with 0 upto n-1. To obtain a 
                    list object of the sequence, it is typecasted to list(). Now this list can be iterated using the 
                    for statement.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        for var in list(range(5)):
                            print (var)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h5>Iterating by Sequence Index</h5>

                <p>
                    An alternative way of iterating through each item is by index offset into the sequence 
                    itself. <br>Following is a simple example :
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        #!/usr/bin/python3
                        fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'mango']
    
                        for index in range(len(fruits)):
                            print ('Current fruit :', fruits[index])
                        print ("Good bye!")
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p id="mini-txt">When you execute the above program, it produces the following result :</p>

                <div>
                    <pre id="output-result">
                        Current fruit : banana

                    </pre>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Here, we took the assistance of the len() built-in function, which provides the total number 
                    of elements in the tuple as well as the range() built-in function to give us the actual 
                    sequence to iterate over
                </p>

                <h5>Using else Statement with Loops</h5>

                <p>Python supports having an else statement associated with a loop statement.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the <b>else</b> statement is used with a <b>for</b> loop, the <b>else</b> block is executed only if for 
                        loops terminates normally (and not by encountering break statement).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the <b>else</b> statement is used with a <b>while</b> loop, the <b>else</b> statement is executed 
                        when the condition becomes false.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The following example illustrates the combination of an else statement with a for
                    statement that searches for even number in given list.

                        for num in numbers:
                            if num%2==0:
                                print ('the list contains an even number')
                                break
                            else:
                                print ('the list doesnot contain even number')

                    <h5>Infinite Loops:</h5>
            
                    <p>
                        Be cautious when using "while loops" to ensure that the condition eventually becomes false. 
                        If not, you may create an infinite loop, which can crash your program.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes FALSE. You must be cautious
                        when using while loops because of the possibility that this condition never resolves to a 
                        FALSE value. This results in a loop that never ends. Such a loop is called an infinite loop.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        An infinite loop might be useful in client/server programming where the server needs to 
                        run continuously so that client programs can communicate with it as and when required.

                <p>
                    Python programming language allows the use of one loop inside another loop. The 
                    following section shows a few examples to illustrate the concept.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    You can nest loops inside each other to create more complex iterations. <br>
                    For example, you can use a "for loop" within another "for loop" to work with two-dimensional data.

                <p>
                    The syntax for a nested while loop statement in Python programming language is as follows :
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code>

                <p>
                    A final note on loop nesting is that you can put any type of loop inside any other type of 
                    loop. For example a for loop can be inside a while loop or vice versa.
                </p>

                <p>In Python, indentation plays a crucial role in determining the structure and execution of your code. <br>
                    Unlike many other programming languages that use braces or other symbols to define code blocks,

            <h3>break, continue and pass Statements:</h3>

            <p>
                In Python, the "break" and "continue" statements are used to control the flow of loops, allowing you to modify the default behavior of looping 
                constructs like "for loops" and "while loops."
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>break</strong> Statement:
                    <p>
                        The "break" statement is used to prematurely exit a loop when a certain condition is met. After 
                        abandoning the loop, execution at the next statement is resumed, just like the traditional 
                        break statement in C.<br>

                        It is often used to terminate a loop when a specific situation or event occurs, even if the loop's conditions are not met. <br>
                        Here's how the "break" statement works:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most common use of break is when some external condition is triggered requiring a 
                        hasty exit from a loop. The <b>break</b> statement can be used in both while and for loops.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you are using nested loops, the break statement stops the execution of the innermost 
                        loop and starts executing the next line of the code after the block
                    </p>

                    <p>In this example, <br> the "break" statement is triggered when the loop reaches the number 5, and the loop is terminated.</p>

                <li><strong>continue</strong> Statement:
                    <p>
                        The "continue" statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration when a certain condition is met. 
                        It allows you to avoid executing some code within the loop for specific items or conditions. Here's how the "continue" statement works:

                    <p>The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops.</p>

                <li><strong>pass</strong> Statement:
                    <p>
                        It is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command 
                        or code to execute.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes. The
                        pass statement is also useful in places where your code will eventually go, but has not 
                        been written yet i.e. in stubs.

            <h5>Use Cases:</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>"Break" and "continue" statements are often used within loops to control program flow based on specific conditions.</li>
                <li>"Break" is useful when you need to exit a loop prematurely, such as when you find the item you're looking for in a list.</li>
                <li>"Continue" is helpful when you want to skip certain iterations, like filtering out specific elements in a loop.</li>
                <li>These statements are commonly used in conjunction with conditional statements (e.g., "if" statements) to determine when to apply them.</li>
            </ul>

                <h5>Nested Loops:</h5>
        
                <p>Both "break" and "continue" statements can be used with nested loops. When used within nested loops, they affect the innermost loop.</p>

                <div id="nest-code">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            for i in range(3):
                                for j in range(3):
                                    if i == 1 and j == 1:
                                        break  # This breaks out of the inner loop only
                                    print(i, j)
                        </code>
                    </pre>

            <p id="lst-desc">
                In summary, "break" and "continue" statements are valuable tools for controlling the flow of loops in Python. 
                They allow you to exit loops prematurely or skip specific iterations based on conditions, providing flexibility and 
                fine-grained control over loop execution.
