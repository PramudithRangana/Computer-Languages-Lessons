        <h1>File Handling in Python</h1>
    </header>

    <section class="top-content">
        <p>
            File handling in Python refers to the process of working with files, which are used to store and manage data. 
            In Python, you can read from and write to files using a set of functions and methods provided by the built-in file handling capabilities. 
            This capability allows you to interact with files on your computer's file system, read data from them, write data to them, 
            and perform various file-related operations.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
        <p>Here are the main operations involved in file handling in Python:</p>
    
        <ol>
            <li><span>Opening a File: </span>
                Before you can read from or write to a file, you need to open it. Python provides the `open()` function for this purpose. 
                You specify the file's name and the mode in which you want to open it (e.g., read mode, write mode, append mode, etc.). 

                <p>For example:</p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        file = open("example.txt", "r")  # Opens "example.txt" in read mode
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
    
            <li><span>Reading from a File: </span>
                You can read the contents of a file using various methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()`. 
                These methods allow you to access the data in the file and process it.
    
                <p>For example:</p>
    
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        content = file.read()  # Reads the entire content of the file
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
    
            <li><SPan>Writing to a File: </SPan>
                You can write data to a file using methods like `write()` or `writelines()`. 
                This allows you to create, modify, or append data in the file. 
                
                <P>For example:</P>
    
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        file = open("example.txt", "w")  # Opens "example.txt" in write mode
                        file.write("Hello, world!")
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
    
            <li><span>Closing a File: </span>
                After you've finished working with a file, it's important to close it using the `close()` method. 
                Closing a file ensures that any changes are saved and that system resources are released. 
    
                <p>For example:</p>
    
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        file.close()
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
    
            <li><span>Context Managers: </span>
                A safer way to work with files is to use a context manager with the `with` statement. 
                This ensures that the file is automatically closed when you're done with it:
    
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
                        content = file.read()
                    # File is automatically closed when the block is exited
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
    
            <li><span>File Modes:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>"r": </span>Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading.</li>
                    <li><span>"w": </span>Write mode. Opens the file for writing (creates a new file or overwrites an existing one).</li>
                    <li><span>"a": </span>Append mode. Opens the file for writing, but appends data to the end (preserving existing content).</li>
                    <li><span>"x": </span>Exclusive creation mode. Creates a new file but fails if it already exists.</li>
                    <li><span>"b": </span>Binary mode. Reads or writes the file in binary mode.</li>
                    <li><span>"t": </span>Text mode (default). Reads or writes the file in text mode (used for text files).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
    
            <li><span>Working with Directories: </span>
                Python's `os` module provides functions for working with directories, including creating, removing, 
                and listing directories.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p id="lst-desc">File handling is essential for a wide range of applications, including reading and writing configuration files, processing data, 
            working with text and binary files, and more. <br>
            It allows Python programs to interact with the file system, which is a fundamental part of many software solutions. <br>
            Proper error handling and resource management are crucial when working with files to ensure data integrity and system stability.
