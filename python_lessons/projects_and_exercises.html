        </ol>
    
        <p id="lst-desc">
            Each project or exercise can correspond to a specific concept or topic covered in your tutorial. 
            It's important to start with simpler exercises for beginners and gradually increase the complexity as your tutorial progresses. 
            Encourage students to work on these projects independently, as practical experience is crucial for their learning and confidence building. 
            Provide starter code or templates to help them get started and offer guidance and solutions as needed.
