                <h4>The `print` Statement</h4>
            
                <p>The `print` statement is used to display output on the console. You can use it to print text, numbers, and the results of expressions. 
                    Here's the basic syntax of the `print` statement:
                </p>

                <p>shell >></p>


                <pre>
                    <code>
                        print("Hello, World!")
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
            
            <div id="hello-ex">
                <h4>Hello World Example:</h4>
            
                <p>
                    The "Hello World" program is often the first program people write in a new programming language. In Python, it's incredibly simple:
                </p>
                
                <p>shell >></p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        print("Hello, World!")
                    </code>
                </pre>
                
                <p>
                    When you run this program, you'll see "Hello, World!" printed to the console. <br>
                    This program serves as a quick way to ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly.
                </p>

            <div id="var-prt">
                <h4>Additional Examples:</h4>
            
                <p>You can also print variables, mathematical expressions, and more using the `print` statement:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        # Printing a variable
                        name = "Alice"
                        print("Hello, " + name)
            
                        # Printing the result of an expression
                        result = 3 + 5
                        print("The result is:", result)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    You can combine text (in double or single quotes) with variables and expressions using the `+` operator, as shown in the examples above.

                <h4>Running Your Python Program:</h4>
            
                <p>To run a Python program, follow these steps:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a Python script (a text file with a `.py` extension) using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).</li>
                    <li>Write your Python code in the script.</li>
                    <li>Save the script with a `.py` file extension. For example, you could save it as `hello.py`.</li>
                    <li>Open a terminal or command prompt.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to the directory where you saved your Python script.</li>
                    <li>Run the script by entering the following command:</li>
                </ol>
            
                <p>shell >></p>

                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>You should see the output displayed on the screen.</p>

                <h2>Python Identifiers</h2>

                <p>
                    A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other 
                    object. An identifier starts with a letter <span>A to Z or a to z</span> or an <span>underscore (_)</span> followed by 
                    <span>zero</span> or <span>more letters</span>, <span>underscores</span> and <span>digits (0 to 9)</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python does not allow punctuation characters such as <span>@</span>, <span>$</span>, and <span>%</span> within identifiers. 
                    <strong>Python is a case sensitive programming language</strong>. (Thus, 'Manpower' and 'manpower' are 
                    two different identifiers in Python.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers-
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a 
                        lowercase letter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier 
                        is private.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strong private 
                        identifier.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language defined special name.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you cannot 
                    use them as constants or variables or any other identifier names. All the Python keywords 
                    contain lowercase letters only.

                <h2>Lines and Indentation</h2>

                <p>
                    Python does not use braces({}) to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions 
                    or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.
                    The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block 
                    must be indented the same amount.
                </p>
                <p> For example :</p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        if True:
                            print ("True")
                        else:
                            print ("False")
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>However, the following block generates an error :</p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        if True:
                            print ("Answer")
                            print ("True")
                        else:
                            print ("Answer")
                            print ("False")
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Thus, in Python all the continuous lines indented with the same number of spaces would 
                    form a block. The following example has various statement blocks
                </p>

                <strong> 
                    Do not try to understand the logic at this point of time. Just make sure you 
                    understood the various blocks even if they are without braces.

                <h2>Multi-Line Statements</h2>
                <p>
                    Statements in Python typically end with a new line. Python, however, allows the use of 
                    the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue.
                </p>
                <p>For example:</p>


                <pre>
                    <code>
                        total = item_one + \
                                item_two + \
                                item_three
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    The statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use the line 
                    continuation character.
                </p>
                <p>For example</p>

                <p>
                    Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, 
                    as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all the

                    A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line and 
                    Python totally ignores it. <br>
                    In an interactive interpreter session, you must enter an empty physical line to terminate

                <p>
                    Here, "\n\n" is used to create two new lines before displaying the actual line. Once the 
                    user presses the key, the program ends. This is a nice trick to keep a console window open

                    Groups of individual statements, which make a single code block are called suites in 
                    Python. Compound or complex statements, such as if, while, def, and class require a

                <p>
                    Header lines begin the statement (with the keyword) and terminate with a colon ( : ) and

                    Python provides a getopt module that helps you parse command-line options and

                <p>
                    The Python sys module provides access to any command-line arguments via

                </ul>

                <p>Here sys.argv[0] is the program i.e. the script name</p>

                <h5>Example</h5>

                <p>Consider the following script <b>test.py</b></p>

                    Python provided a <b>getopt</b> module that helps you parse command-line options and

                        options, which require an argument should be followed by an equal sign ('='). To 
                        accept only long options, options should be an empty string.

            <h3>Variables and Data Types</h3>

            <div id="var-intro">
                <p>
                    Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when 
                    you create a variable, you reserve some space in the memory. <br><br>
                    Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what 
                    can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to the 
                    variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Python, variables are used to store data, and each variable has a data type that specifies the kind of data it can hold. 
                    Python supports various data types, but three fundamental ones are integers, floating-point numbers, and strings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration 
                    happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used 
                    to assign values to variables. <br><br>
                    The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to 
                    the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. 
                </p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>Integers (`int`):</li>
                    <p>
                        Integers are whole numbers without a fractional component. 
                        You can use them for counting, indexing, and performing arithmetic operations. <br> Here's how you declare and use integers in Python:
                    </p>
    
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            # Declaring an integer variable
                            age = 25
            
                            # Performing arithmetic operations
                            x = 5
                            y = 3
                            sum_result = x + y
                            difference = x - y
                            product = x * y
                            quotient = x / y
                        </code>
                    </pre>
    
                    <li>Floating-Point Numbers (`float`):</li>
                    <p>
                        Floating-point numbers, or floats, represent real numbers with a decimal point or an exponent (e.g., 3.14 or 2.7e-3). 
                        You can use floats for precise numerical calculations:
                    </p>
    
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            # Declaring a float variable
                            pi = 3.14159
            
                            # Performing floating-point arithmetic
                            radius = 4.0
                            area = 3.14159 * (radius ** 2)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
            
                    <li>Strings (`str`):</li>
                    <p>
                        Strings are sequences of characters and are used to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to define strings. <br>
                        Here's how you work with strings in Python:
                    </p>
    
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            # Declaring a string variable
                            greeting = "Hello, World!"
            
                            # Concatenating strings
                            name = "Alice"
                            message = "Hello, " + name
    
                            # String methods
                            text = "python is fun"
                            uppercase_text = text.upper()
                            length = len(text)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h3>Multiple Assignment</h3>
                <p>
                    Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                    a = b = c = 1
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Here, an integer object is created with the value 1, and all the three variables are assigned 
                    to the same memory location.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables :
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                    a, b, c = 1, 2, "john"
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Here, two integer objects with values 1 and 2 are assigned to the variables a and b 
                    respectively, and one string object with the value "john" is assigned to the variable c.

                <ul>
                    <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., `age` and `Age` are different variables).</li>
                    <li>Variable names can consist of <span>letters</span>, <span>numbers</span>, and <span>underscores</span>, <b>but they must start with a letter or an underscore</b>.</li>
                    <li>Variable names should be descriptive and follow a naming convention (e.g., snake_case for variables).</li>
                    <li>Avoid using Python reserved words (keywords) for variable names (e.g., `print`, `if`, `while`).</li>

                <p>
                    You can convert between different data types in Python. <br>
                    For example, you can convert an integer to a float or a float to an integer using casting:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        # Casting from int to float
                        integer_number = 10
                        float_number = float(integer_number)

                        # Casting from float to int (this truncates the decimal part)
                        float_value = 12.7
                        integer_value = int(float_value)

                    Understanding variables and data types is crucial for any programming language. <br>
                    They form the foundation for working with data, performing calculations, and handling user input. <br>

            <h3>Comments in Python:</h3>
            
            <p>
                Comments are essential in any programming language as they allow you to add explanatory notes to your code. <br>
                Comments are not executed by the Python interpreter; instead, they serve as documentation for you and other developers who work with the code. <br>
                In Python, comments start with the `#` symbol, and anything following the `#` on a line is considered a comment.
            </p>
        
            <div class="sngl-comt">
                <h4>Single-Line Comments:</h4>
            
                <p>
                    Single-line comments are used for brief explanations or notes about specific lines of code. 
                    They start with the `<span>#</span>` symbol and continue to the end of the line.
                </p>
            
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        # This is a single-line comment
                        x = 10  # Assigning a value to the variable x
                    </code>

                <h4>Multi-Line Comments:</h4>
            
                <p>
                    Python does not have a specific syntax for multi-line comments. <br>
                    However, you can use triple-quotes (either single or double) to create multi-line strings, which can serve as multi-line comments. <br>
                    While these "comments" are not ignored by Python, they are often used as a convention for multi-line explanations.
                </p>
            
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        """
                        This is a multi-line comment.
                        You can use triple-quotes to add detailed explanations.
                        This text is considered a string but is not assigned to a variable.
                        """

                <h3>The Importance of Comments:</h3>
            
                <h5>Comments are crucial for the following reasons:</h5>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>Code Documentation:
                        <p>
                            Comments provide information about how the code works, what specific parts of the code do, and why certain decisions were made. 
                            This is invaluable for you and other developers who need to understand and maintain the code.
                        </p>
                    </li>
            
                    <li>Code Readability:
                        <p>
                            Well-documented code is more readable and easier to understand. <br>
                            Clear and concise comments can make your code more accessible and maintainable.
                        </p>
                    </li>
            
                    <li>Debugging and Troubleshooting:
                        <p>
                            Comments can help you identify and fix issues in your code by providing context and explanations of 
                            what each part of the code is intended to do.
                        </p>
                    </li>
            
                    <li>Collaboration:
                        <p>
                            When working on projects with multiple developers, comments ensure that everyone is on the same page and 
                            can understand each other's code.
                        </p>

                </ol>

                <h3>Best Practices for Writing Comments:</h3>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Be Clear and Concise: </span>
                        <ul>Write comments that are easy to understand and get to the point.</ul>

                    <li><span>Use Proper Grammar: </span>
                        <ul>Follow good writing practices and use correct spelling and grammar in your comments.</ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Avoid Redundancy: </span>
                        <ul>Don't repeat the obvious in comments. Focus on explaining why, not what.</ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Update Comments: </span>
                        <ul>Keep comments up-to-date as you modify your code. Outdated comments can lead to confusion.</ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Use Comments Sparingly: </span>
                        <ul>While comments are valuable, avoid over-commenting your code. Let the code speak for itself when it's self-explanatory.</ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Follow a Comment Style Guide: </span>
                        <ul>If you're working on a team or contributing to open-source projects, follow any comment style guidelines established by the project.</ul>
