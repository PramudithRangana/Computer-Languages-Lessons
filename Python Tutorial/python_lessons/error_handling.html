        <p>
            Error handling is a crucial aspect of programming that allows you to gracefully handle unexpected situations 
            or errors that may occur during the execution of your code. <br>
            In Python, you can use the `try-except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions, preventing your program from crashing due to errors.
        </p>

            <h3>Try-Except Blocks</h3>

            <p>
                The `try-except` block is used to enclose code that may potentially raise exceptions. 
                It provides a mechanism to catch and handle these exceptions, allowing your program to continue executing even if an error occurs. 
                Here's the basic structure of a `try-except` block:
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    try:
                        # Code that may raise an exception
                    except ExceptionType:
                        # Code to handle the exception
                </code>
            </pre>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="ex-h">`try:`: </span>The `try` block contains the code that you want to monitor for exceptions.</li>
                <li><span class="ex-h">`except ExceptionType:`: </span>The `except` block is executed when an exception of the specified `ExceptionType` occurs in the `try` block. 
                    You can specify the type of exception you want to catch. If you don't specify an exception type, it will catch all exceptions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="assrt">
            <h3>Assertions in Python</h3>

            <p>
                An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with 
                your testing of the program.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a <b>raise-if</b> statement (or to 
                    be more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). An expression is tested, and if the 
                    result comes up false, an exception is raised.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assertions are carried out by the assert statement, the newest keyword to Python, 
                    introduced in version 1.5.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for valid 
                    input, and after a function call to check for valid output.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The assert Statement</h4>

            <p>
                When it encounters an assert statement, Python evaluates the accompanying expression, 
                which is hopefully true. If the expression is false, Python raises 
                anAssertionError exception.
            </p>

            <p>The syntax for assert is :</p>

            <pre class="stx">
                <code>
                assert Expression[, Arguments]
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the 
                AssertionError. AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled like any other 
                exception, using the try-except statement. If they are not handled, they will terminate the 
                program and produce a traceback.
            </p>

            <h6>Example :</h6>

            <p>
                Here is a function that converts a given temperature from degrees Kelvin to degrees 
                Fahrenheit. Since 0Â° K is as cold as it gets, the function bails out if it sees a negative 
                temperature
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    #!/usr/bin/python3
                    def KelvinToFahrenheit(Temperature):
                        assert (Temperature >= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!"
                        return ((Temperature-273)*1.8)+32

                    print (KelvinToFahrenheit(273))
                    print (int(KelvinToFahrenheit(505.78)))
                    print (KelvinToFahrenheit(-5))
                </code>
            </pre>

        <div class="handle-exc">
            <h3>What is Exception?</h3>

            <p>
                An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts 
                the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters 
                a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object 
                that represents an error.
            </p>

            <p>
                When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately 
                otherwise it terminates and quits.
            </p>

            <h3>Handling exceptions</h3>

            <div class="hndl-exc">
                <p>
                    When an exception is raised in the `try` block, the program flow immediately jumps to the corresponding `except` block. 
                    You can include code in the `except` block to handle the exception or take appropriate actions. <br>For example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        try:
                            result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
                        except ZeroDivisionError:
                            print("Error: Division by zero.")
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    In this example, a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs when attempting to divide by zero. The `except ZeroDivisionError` block catches the exception and prints an error message.
                </p>

                <ul class="hndl-exc-ul">
                    <li>
                        A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when 
                        the try block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.
                    </li>
                    <li> You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception.</li>
                    <li>
                        After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The code in the else block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's 
                        protection.
                    </li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>You can catch multiple exceptions by using multiple `except` blocks or by specifying multiple exception types in a single `except` block:</p>
    
                <pre>
                    <code>

            <h3>Raising an Exception</h3>

            <p>
                You can raise exceptions in several ways by using the raise statement. The general syntax 
                for the raise statement is as follows
            </p>

            <h6>Syntax</h6>

            <pre class="stx">
                <code>
                raise [Exception [, args [, traceback]]]
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                Here, Exception is the type of exception (for example, NameError) and argument is a 
                value for the exception argument. The argument is optional; if not supplied, the exception 
                argument is None.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final argument, traceback, is also optional (and rarely used in practice), and if present, 
                is the traceback object used for the exception.
            </p>

            <h6>Example :</h6>

            <p>
                An exception can be a string, a class or an object. Most of the exceptions that the Python 
                core raises are classes, with an argument that is an instance of the class. Defining new 
                exceptions is quite easy and can be done as follows
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    def functionName( level ):
                        if level < 1:
                            raise Exception(level)
                            # The code below to this would not be executed
                            # if we raise the exception
                        return level
                </code>
            </pre>

            <strong>
                Note: In order to catch an exception, an "except" clause must refer to the same exception 
                thrown either as a class object or a simple string. For example, to capture the above 
                exception, we must write the except clause as follows
            </strong>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    try:
                        Business Logic here...
                    except Exception as e:
                        Exception handling here using e.args...
                    else:
                        Rest of the code here...
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>The following example illustrates the use of raising an exception :</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    #!/usr/bin/python3
                    def functionName( level ):
                        if level < 1:
                            raise Exception(level)
                            # The code below to this would not be executed
                            # if we raise the exception
                        return level
                    
                    try:
                        l = functionName(-10)
                        print("level=",l)
                    except Exception as e:
                        print("error in level argument",e.args[0])
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>

        <div class="user-def">

            <h3>User-Defined Exceptions</h3>

            <p>
                Python also allows you to create your own exceptions by deriving classes from the standard 
                built-in exceptions. <br>
                Here is an example related to RuntimeError. Here, a class is created that is subclassed 
                from RuntimeError. This is useful when you need to display more specific information when 
                an exception is caught. <br>

                In the try block, the user-defined exception is raised and caught in the except block. The 
                variable e is used to create an instance of the class Networkerror.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    class Networkerror(RuntimeError):
                        def __init__(self, arg):
                            self.args = arg
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>So once you have defined the above class, you can raise the exception as follows :</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    try:
                        raise Networkerror("Bad hostname")
                    except Networkerror, e:
                        print e.args
                </code>
