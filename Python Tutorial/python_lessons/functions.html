            In computer programming, a function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. 
            Functions are used to encapsulate and organize code, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. 
            They play a fundamental role in structuring and simplifying complex programs.

                <p>Here are some key characteristics of functions:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Modularity: </span>Functions allow you to break down a program into smaller, manageable units. 
                        Each function is responsible for a specific task, making the code more organized and easier to work with.
                    </li>
            
                    <li><span>Reusability: </span>Functions can be defined once and used multiple times throughout a program. 
                        This promotes code reuse and helps avoid redundancy.
                    </li>
            
                    <li><span>Abstraction: </span>Functions provide an abstraction layer, allowing you to use a function without needing to know the implementation details. 
                        You only need to know the function's name and how to use it.
                    </li>
            
                    <li><span>Parameterization: </span>Functions can accept input data, known as parameters or arguments, which can be used within the function to perform operations. 
                        Parameters make functions flexible and versatile.
                    </li>
            
                    <li><span>Return Values: </span>Functions can return a result or value, which can be used in other parts of the program. 
                        This allows functions to provide output or information back to the calling code.
                    </li>
            
                    <li><span>Encapsulation: </span>Functions can encapsulate a series of statements and variables, preventing them from interfering with the rest of the program. 
                        This helps maintain data integrity and avoid naming conflicts.

                <h4>Function Structure in Python:</h4>
            
                <p>
                    In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses. 
                    Any parameters the function accepts are listed inside the parentheses, and a colon (`:`) indicates the beginning of the function's code block. 
                    The function body is indented, and it contains the statements to be executed when the function is called.
                </p>
            
                <h5>Here's a basic structure of a Python function:</h5>
            
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        def my_function(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
                            # Function code
                            # ...
                            return result  # Optional return statement
                    </code>
                </pre>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>`my_function` is the function name.</li>
                    <li>`parameter1`, `parameter2`, and so on are the function's parameters.</li>
                    <li>The function code consists of statements to perform the desired task.</li>
                    <li>The `return` statement (optional) is used to specify the value to be returned by the function.</li>

                    <li>`my_function` is the function name.</li>
                    <li>`arg1`, `arg2`, and so on are the actual arguments you pass to the function.</li>

        <section class="para-arg">
            <h3>Parameters and Arguments:</h3>
        
            <p>
                In the context of functions, "parameters" and "arguments" are two important concepts that relate to how data is passed to and used within functions. 
                They play a crucial role in defining and calling functions.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Parameters:</h4>
        
            <p> Parameters are variables or placeholders defined in a function's signature (the part where you declare the function) that specify 
                what data the function expects to receive when it is called. 
            </p>
        
            <p>Parameters act as input variables to the function and serve as a way for the function to interact with the outside world.</p>
        
            <p>
                In Python, parameters are listed inside the parentheses of the function definition and are used like variables within the function's code block. <br>
                Here's an example of a function with parameters:
            </p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    def greet(name, greeting):
                        message = f"{greeting}, {name}!"
                        print(message)
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <p>
                In this example, `name` and `greeting` are parameters. When the `greet` function is called, it expects two arguments to be provided 
                (one for `name` and one for `greeting`). The values of these arguments will be used within the function to create a personalized greeting message.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Arguments:</h4>
        
            <p> 
                Arguments, on the other hand, are the actual values or expressions that are provided when calling a function. <br>
                They are passed to the function to be used as the values of the corresponding parameters. <br>
                In other words, arguments are the data that you send to a function when you want it to perform a specific task.
            </p>
        
            <p>Here's how you call the `greet` function with arguments:</p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    greet("Alice", "Hello")
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <p>
                In this function call, `"Alice"` and `"Hello"` are arguments. <br>
                The first argument corresponds to the `name` parameter, and the second argument corresponds to the `greeting` parameter. <br>
                These arguments are used within the function to create the personalized greeting message.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Parameter vs. Argument:</h4>
        
            <h5>To summarize the difference:</h5>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Parameters are variables defined in a function's signature that specify what data the function expects to receive.</li>
                <li>Arguments are the actual values or expressions passed to a function when it is called, filling in the placeholders (parameters).</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Function Signature:</h4>
        
            <p>
                The function signature includes the function's name and its parameter list. <br>
                For example, in the function `greet(name, greeting)`, the signature consists of the function name "greet" and the parameters "name" and "greeting."
            </p>
        
            <h4>Matching Arguments and Parameters:</h4>
        
        
            <p>
                When you call a function, you need to ensure that the number and order of the arguments match the number and 
                order of the parameters in the function's definition. <br>
                For example, if you have a function with two parameters, you should provide two arguments in the same order when calling the function.
            </p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    greet("Alice", "Hello")  # Correct
                    greet("Hello", "Alice")  # Incorrect (order is important)
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <p id="lst-desc">
                In summary, parameters and arguments are fundamental concepts in function usage. <br>
                Parameters define what data a function expects to receive, while arguments are the actual values or 
                expressions provided to the function to perform a specific task. Proper matching of arguments and 
                parameters is crucial for the function to work correctly.

            <h3>Return Statements:</h3>
        
            <p>
                In programming, a "return statement" is a fundamental component of a function that defines what value the function should produce as its output. <br>
                When a function is called and its code is executed, the return statement is used to send a result back to the caller of the function. <br>
                This result can be a single value, a data structure (like a list or dictionary), or even `None` if the function doesn't need to produce 
                a specific result.
            </p>
        
            <h5>Here's the basic syntax of a return statement in Python:</h5>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    def my_function(parameters):
                        # Function code
                        # ...
                        return result  # The result can be a variable, expression, or literal value
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <h5>Key points about return statements:</h5>
        
            <ol>
                <li><span class="kp-return">Return Value: </span>The value specified after the `return` keyword is what the function will produce as its output. 
                    This value can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, or custom objects.
                </li>
                
                <li><span class="kp-return">Optional: </span>Not all functions need to have a return statement. Some functions may be used purely for their side effects 
                    (e.g., printing, modifying global variables) and don't need to produce a return value.
                </li>
        
                <li><span class="kp-return">Function Termination: </span>When a return statement is encountered in a function, it immediately exits the function and 
                    returns the specified value to the caller. Any code after the return statement in the function will not be executed.
                </li>
                
                <li><span class="kp-return">Single Return: </span>A function can have only one return statement. Once the return statement is executed, the function's execution ends, and
                    control is returned to the calling code.
                </li>
            </ol>
        
            <h5>Examples:</h5>
        
            <ol>
                <li>A function that returns a single value:</li>
        
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        def add_numbers(a, b):
                            result = a + b
                            return result
        
                        # Calling the function and capturing the result
                        sum_result = add_numbers(3, 4)
                        print(sum_result)  # Output: 7
                    </code>
                </pre>
                
                <li>A function that returns a data structure (list):</li>
        
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        def create_list():
                            my_list = [1, 2, 3]
                            return my_list
        
                        # Calling the function and capturing the result
                        result_list = create_list()
                        print(result_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
                    </code>
                </pre>
        
                <li>A function with no return statement (implicitly returns `None`):</li>
        
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        def print_greeting(name):
                            print(f"Hello, {name}!")
        
                        # Calling the function (no return value captured)
                        print_greeting("Alice")
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </ol>

            <P>
                In this example, the `print_greeting` function doesn't have an explicit return statement, so it implicitly returns `None`. 
                This is common for functions that primarily have side effects (in this case, printing) and don't need to produce a specific result.
            </P>

            <P id="lst-desc">
                Return statements are essential for functions to provide meaningful output and communicate results back to the calling code. 
                Properly using return statements is key to building effective and reusable functions.

            <h3>Scope and Namespaces:</h3>

            <p>
                In programming, "scope" and "namespaces" are concepts that determine the visibility and accessibility of variables, functions, and 
                other symbols within a program. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing organized, bug-free, and maintainable code.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li id="nm-spc">Namespaces:</li>

                <p>
                    A "namespace" is a container that holds a collection of identifiers (such as variable names, function names, and class names) and 
                    their associated objects (values or functions). 
                    Each namespace serves as a way to organize and group related symbols to avoid naming conflicts and to provide a context for interpreting symbols.
                </p>

                <p>In Python, there are several namespaces:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span>Global Namespace: </span> This is the top-level namespace in a Python program. <br>
                        It contains symbols defined at the top level of the program (outside of any function or class). <br>
                        Global variables and functions are accessible from anywhere in the program.
                    </li>

                    <li><span>Local Namespace: </span>Local namespaces are created when you define a function or a method. <br>
                        These namespaces hold function-specific variables and parameters. <br>
                        Local variables are only accessible within the function where they are defined.

                    <li><span>Enclosing Namespace (Non-local Namespace): </span>In Python, nested functions are allowed. 
                        When an inner function is defined within an outer function, 
                        the inner function can access variables from the outer function's namespace. <br>
                        These outer variables are considered part of the enclosing (non-local) namespace for 
                        the inner function.
                    </li>

                    <li><span>Built-in Namespace: </span>This namespace contains a collection of built-in Python functions and objects. 
                        You can access these symbols without importing any modules because they are always available.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <li id="nm-scp">Scope:</li>

                <p>
                    "Scope" defines the region or context within which a symbol (such as a variable or function) is accessible and can be referenced. 
                    In Python, there are three primary types of scope:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span>Local Scope: </span>
                        Variables and functions defined within a function have local scope. They are only accessible from within that function.
                    </li>

                    <li><span>Enclosing Scope (Non-local Scope): </span>
                        Variables from the outer (enclosing) function are accessible within an inner function. 
                        This is known as non-local scope.
                    </li>

                    <li><span>Global Scope: </span>
                        Variables and functions defined at the top level of a program have global scope. 
                        They are accessible from any part of the program, including from within functions.
                    </li>

                    <li><span>Built-in Scope: </span>
                        Symbols defined in the built-in namespace are available globally, which means they can be accessed from any part of the program.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <p>Here's a simple example to illustrate scope and namespaces in Python:</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    # Global scope
                    global_variable = 10
        
                    def outer_function():
                        # Enclosing (non-local) scope
                        outer_variable = 20
        
                        def inner_function():
                            # Local scope
                            local_variable = 30
                            print(global_variable, outer_variable, local_variable)
        
                        inner_function()
        
                    outer_function()
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                In this example, `global_variable` is in the global scope, `outer_variable` is in the enclosing scope of `outer_function`, 
                and `local_variable` is in the local scope of `inner_function`. <br>
                The inner function can access variables from the enclosing and global scopes, but not vice versa.
            </p>

            <p id="lst-desc">
                Understanding scope and namespaces is crucial for avoiding naming conflicts, managing variable visibility, and writing modular and organized code. 
                It also plays a key role in variable lifetime, allowing you to manage when and how long variables persist in memory.
