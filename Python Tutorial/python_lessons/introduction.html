            <h3>What is Python ?</h3>

            <p>
                Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 
                It was created by <b>Guido van Rossum</b> and first released in 1991.
            </p>

            <p>
                Python is often chosen as a programming language for beginners due to its clear and easy-to-understand syntax, 
                making it an excellent choice for those new to coding.
            </p>

            <p>
                Python is widely used in various fields, including web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, 
                and more. It has a vast and active community of developers, which means there is a wealth of libraries and packages available to help you accomplish various tasks.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of Python's key strengths is its emphasis on code readability. 
                Its syntax uses indentation (whitespace) to delimit code blocks, which enforces a clean and organized coding style. 
                This feature makes Python code more accessible and maintainable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Python is known for its extensive standard library, which provides modules and packages for a wide range of tasks. 
                Additionally, Python supports third-party libraries and frameworks, such as Django, Flask, NumPy, and TensorFlow, 
                which extend its capabilities for specific purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
                In summary, Python is a powerful and flexible programming language that can be used for a variety of applications, 
                making it a valuable tool for both beginners and experienced programmers.

            <h3>Setting up Python (Installation)</h3>
        
            <p>Before you can start learning and programming in Python, you need to set up the Python environment on your computer. Python can be easily installed on various operating systems.</p>
        
            <p>Here are the steps to get started:</p>
        
            <ol>
                <li><span>Check if Python is Already Installed:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some operating systems, like macOS and many Linux distributions, come with Python pre-installed. To check if Python is already on your system, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>shell :</h6>
                    <code>
                        python --version
                    </code>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If you see a version number (e.g., Python 3.9.2), it means Python is already installed. You can proceed with this version, or you may choose to install a specific Python version.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><span>Download Python:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If Python is not already installed or if you want to install a specific version, 
                            you can download the official Python installer from the Python Software Foundation's website (<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><span>Installing Python on Windows:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Download the Windows installer from the Python website.</li>
                        <li>Run the installer and make sure to check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH" (X.X represents the Python version you're installing). This makes it easier to run Python from the command prompt.</li>
                        <li>Follow the installation prompts and complete the setup.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><span>Installing Python on macOS:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Download the macOS installer from the Python website.</li>
                        <li>Run the installer, and it will guide you through the installation process.<br>
                        Python on macOS typically comes pre-installed, but using the installer ensures you have control over the Python version and environment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><span>Installing Python on Linux:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. <br> 
                            However, to install a specific version or to ensure it's up to date, you can use your package manager. <br>
                            For example, on Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu), you can use the following command to install Python 3:</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>shell :</h6>
                    <code>
                        sudo apt-get install python3
                    </code>
                </li>
                
                <li><span>Verify Installation:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Python has been successfully installed:</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h6>shell :</h6>
                    <code>
                        python --version
                    </code>
                </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>You should see the installed Python version displayed on the screen.</li>
                </ul>

                <li><span>Using Python IDEs (Optional):</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While Python can be run from the command line, 
                            many developers prefer using Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for a more user-friendly coding experience. <br>
                            Some popular Python IDEs include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Jupyter Notebook.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
