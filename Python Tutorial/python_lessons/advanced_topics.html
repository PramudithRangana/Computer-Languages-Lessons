        <h3>Regular Expressions:</h3>
        <div class="regx">
        
            <p>
                Regular expressions, often referred to as regex or regexp, are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text processing. <br>
                They provide a way to define search patterns and perform operations such as searching, matching, replacing, and extracting text from strings. <br>
                Python's `re` module is the standard library module for working with regular expressions.
            </p>
        
            <p>Here's a simple example of using regular expressions to search for patterns in a text:</p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import re
        
                    text = "Hello, my email is john@example.com and my friend's email is jane@example.com."
                    pattern = r'\w+@\w+\.\w+'
        
                    emails = re.findall(pattern, text)
                    print(emails)  # Output: ['john@example.com', 'jane@example.com']
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <p>
                Regular expressions can be used for tasks like validation, text parsing, data extraction, and more, making them a powerful tool for working with 
                textual data.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Multithreading and Multiprocessing:</h3>
        <div class="multi-trd">
        
            <p>
                Multithreading and multiprocessing are techniques for concurrent programming, allowing you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. 
                In Python, you can use the `threading` module for multithreading and the `multiprocessing` module for multiprocessing.
            </p>
        
            <p><span>Multithreading: </span>
                Multithreading allows you to run multiple threads within a single process. <br>
                Threads share the same memory space and can be used for tasks that involve I/O-bound operations, such as network requests or file reading.
            </p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import threading
        
                    def print_numbers():
                        for i in range(1, 6):
                            print("Number:", i)
        
                    def print_letters():
                        for letter in 'abcde':
                            print("Letter:", letter)
        
                    # Create and start two threads
                    thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
                    thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)
                    thread1.start()
                    thread2.start()
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <p><span>Multiprocessing: </span>
                Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space, allowing them to work on CPU-bound tasks in
                parallel. The `multiprocessing` module is particularly useful for tasks that require significant computation.
            </p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import multiprocessing
        
                    def square(number):
                        return number * number
        
                    if __name__ == "__main__":
                        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
                        with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
                            squared = pool.map(square, numbers)
                        print(squared)
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>

        <h3>Database Connectivity (SQLite and SQLAlchemy):</h3>
        <div class="dbcon">
        
        
            <h4>SQLite:</h4>
        
            <p>
                SQLite is a lightweight and embedded relational database management system that doesn't require a separate server process and 
                is often used for small-scale applications. Python's `sqlite3` module provides a simple way to interact with SQLite databases.
            </p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import sqlite3
        
                    # Connect to a SQLite database (or create one if it doesn't exist)
                    conn = sqlite3.connect("my_database.db")
        
                    # Create a cursor object to interact with the database
                    cursor = conn.cursor()
        
                    # Execute SQL queries
                    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, email TEXT)")
                    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", ("Alice", "alice@example.com"))
        
                    # Commit changes and close the database connection
                    conn.commit()
                    conn.close()
                </code>
            </pre>
       
            <h4>SQLAlchemy:</h4>
        
            <p>
                SQLAlchemy is a popular Python library that provides a higher-level, object-oriented interface to relational databases. 
                It supports multiple database management systems, offering more flexibility and powerful tools for working with databases.
            </p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
                    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
                    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
        
                    # Create an SQLite database using SQLAlchemy
                    engine = create_engine("sqlite:///my_database.db")
        
                    # Define a model (table) using SQLAlchemy's ORM
                    Base = declarative_base()
        
                    class User(Base):
                        __tablename__ = "users"
                        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
                        name = Column(String)
                        email = Column(String)
        
                    # Create tables in the database
                    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
        
                    # Create a session to interact with the database
                    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
                    session = Session()
        
                    # Insert data into the database
                    new_user = User(name="Bob", email="bob@example.com")
                    session.add(new_user)
                    session.commit()
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <p>
                SQLAlchemy simplifies database operations and provides object-relational mapping, making it a popular choice for working with databases in Python.
