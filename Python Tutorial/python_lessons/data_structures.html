        <p>
            A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. <br>
            It defines a set of rules for how data can be organized, accessed, and modified. <br>
            Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and play a crucial role in writing efficient and organized programs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Data structures are used to represent and manage different types of data, from simple elements like numbers and 
            characters to complex structures like databases and more. They serve as the foundation for various algorithms and operations in programming.
        </p>

        <p>Data structures can be broadly categorized into two types:</p>
    
        <ol>
            <li id="pri">
                <span id="pri-span">Primitive Data Structures: </span>These are basic data types provided by the programming language, like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, 
                and booleans. They are typically used to represent individual values.
            </li>

            <li id="n-pri">
                <span id="n-pri-span">Non-Primitive Data Structures: </span>These are more complex structures that can hold multiple values, often of different types, 
                and are used to represent more intricate data. Non-primitive data structures include arrays, lists, sets, dictionaries (maps), trees, graphs, 
                and more.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
        <div class="data-struc-type" id="data-intro">
                <p>Some common data structures include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> <span> Arrays: </span>A collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key.</li>
            
                    <li> <span>Lists: </span>Ordered collections of elements, which may be of different types.</li>
            
                    <li> <span>Sets: </span>Collections of unique elements with no specific order.</li>
            
                    <li> <span>Dictionaries (Maps): </span>Key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value.</li>
            
                    <li> <span>Stacks and Queues: </span>Data structures for managing collections of items, typically with last-in-first-out (LIFO) or first-in-first-out (FIFO) order.</li>
            
                    <li> <span>Trees: </span>Hierarchical data structures with nodes and edges, used for various applications, such as binary trees and binary search trees.</li>

            <p>
                The choice of a data structure depends on the specific needs of a program. Different data structures are optimized for different operations. 
                For example, arrays are efficient for accessing elements by index, while dictionaries (maps) are suitable for fast key-based retrieval.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Understanding data structures and their characteristics is essential for designing efficient algorithms, 
                as the choice of data structure can significantly impact the time and space complexity of operations in your code.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the study of data structures, you'll explore how to create, manipulate, and optimize data structures for different programming tasks, 
                and you'll learn when to choose one data structure over another to solve specific problems efficiently.

            <h3>Arrays</h3>
            <p>
                An array is a fundamental data structure used to store and manage a collection of elements of the same data type. <br>
                Arrays are widely used in programming because they provide a systematic and efficient way to store and access data. <br>
                Each element in an array is identified by an index, and arrays are typically used when you need to work with a fixed number of elements.
            </p>
    
            <p>Here are some key characteristics of arrays:</p>
        
            <div id="charc-array">
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Homogeneous: </span>
                        <ul>All elements in an array must be of the same data type, whether they are integers, floating-point numbers, characters, 
                            or any other data type.</ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Fixed Size:</span>
                        <ul>Arrays have a fixed size determined when they are created. The size remains constant throughout their lifetime.</ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Zero-Based Indexing:</span>
                        <ul> Elements in an array are accessed via an index, with the first element having an index of 0. 
                            This means that the last element in an array of size N has an index of N-1.</ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Contiguous Memory:</span>
                        <ul>Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, making it efficient to access elements by index.</ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        
            <h4>Creating and Accessing Arrays:</h4>
        
            <p>In Python, you can create arrays using lists. Here's how to create an array and access its elements:</p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        
                    # Accessing elements
                    first_element = my_array[0]  # Access the first element
                    second_element = my_array[1]  # Access the second element
                </code>
                
            </pre>
            <h4>Common Array Operations:</h4>
        
            <div id="com-array-op">
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Insertion:</b> You can add elements to an array at the beginning, end, or any specific index.</li>
                    <li><b>Deletion:</b> You can remove elements from an array, which may involve shifting other elements to fill the gap.</li>
                    <li><b>Updating:</b> You can modify elements in an array by assigning a new value to a specific index.</li>
                    <li><b>Searching:</b> You can search for a specific element within an array, often using loops.</li>
                    <li><b>Traversal:</b> You can iterate through all elements in the array, typically using loops.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
    
            <div>
                <h4>Arrays vs. Lists in Python:</h4>
            
                <p>
                    In Python, the term "list" is often used interchangeably with arrays. However, Python's lists are more versatile than traditional arrays. <br>
                    Lists in Python can hold elements of different data types, and they are dynamically sized (i.e., their size can change during program execution).
                </p>
                
                <p>Here's an example of using a Python list:</p>
            
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'four', 5.0]
                    </code>
                </pre>
            
                <p id="lst-desc">
                    In summary, arrays are essential for efficiently managing a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type. <br>
                    While Python lists offer more flexibility, traditional arrays are used in many other programming languages 
                    and are a foundational concept in computer science and software development. <br>
                    Understanding how to work with arrays is important for building efficient algorithms and data structures.

            <h3>Lists</h3>

            <p>
                In Python, a list is a versatile and commonly used data structure that allows you to store and manage collections of elements. Lists are similar to arrays in other programming languages but offer more flexibility and functionality. <br><br>

                They are used to hold an ordered collection of items, which can be of different data types, and are dynamically sized 
                (i.e., they can grow or shrink during program execution).
            </p>

            <p>Here are some key characteristics of lists in Python:</p>
        
            <div id="charc-list-py">
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Heterogeneous:</span>
                        <ul>
                            Lists can hold elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, floats, and more.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Dynamic Size:</span>
                        <ul>
                            You can add or remove elements from a list, and its size can change during program execution.
                        </ul> 
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Ordered:</span> 
                        <ul>
                            Lists maintain the order of elements, meaning the first element in the list is accessed with index 0, the second with index 1, and so on.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Creating Lists:</h4>
        
            <p>You can create lists in Python by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements within square brackets. <br>Here's how to create a list:</p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'four', 5.0]
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <h5>Accessing List Elements:</h5>
        
            <p>You can access elements in a list using their indices, with the first element having an index of 0. <br>For example:</p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    first_element = my_list[0]  # Access the first element (1)
                    second_element = my_list[1]  # Access the second element (2)
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <h5>Common List Operations:</h5>

            <h3>Tuples</h3>
        
            <p>
                In Python, a tuple is an ordered, immutable, and heterogeneous collection of elements. <br>
                Tuples are similar to lists, but they have a key difference: once you create a tuple, you cannot change its contents (immutable). <br>
                Tuples are often used to group related data, and they are a fundamental data structure in Python.
            </p>
    
            <p>Here are some key characteristics of tuples:</p>
        
            <div id="charc-tuple">
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Heterogeneous: </span>
                        <ul>
                            Tuples can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, floats, and more.
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><span>Ordered: </span>
                        <ul>
                            Like lists, tuples maintain the order of elements, and you can access elements by their indices.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                
                    <li><span>Immutable: </span>
                        <ul>
                            Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. 
                          This immutability makes tuples suitable for situations where you want to ensure the data remains constant.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        
            <h5>Creating Tuples:</h5>
        
            <p>You can create tuples in Python by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements within parentheses. <br>Here's how to create a tuple:</p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    my_tuple = (1, 'two', 3.0, (4, 5))
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <h5>Accessing Tuple Elements:</h5>
        
            <p>You can access elements in a tuple using their indices, with the first element having an index of 0, just like in lists. <br>For example:</p>
        
            <pre>
                <code>
                    first_element = my_tuple[0]  # Access the first element (1)
                    second_element = my_tuple[1]  # Access the second element ('two')
                </code>
            </pre>
        
            <h5>Common Tuple Operations:</h5>
        
            <p>Since tuples are immutable, you can't change their elements directly. However, you can perform various operations on tuples, such as:</p>

                A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a 
                number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within 
                parenthesis. <br>
                The main difference between lists and tuples is- Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and 
                their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) 
                and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.

                        print (tinytuple * 2) # Prints tuple two times

            <h3>Sets</h3>

            <p>
                In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are used to store and manipulate data in a way that ensures uniqueness 
                and provides efficient membership testing. <br>
                They are a fundamental data structure in Python and are often used for tasks that involve testing for membership, finding unique elements, 
                and performing mathematical set operations.
            </p>

            <p>Here are some key characteristics of sets:</p>
    
            <div id="charc-sets">
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Unordered: </span>
                        <ul>
                            Sets do not maintain the order of elements. The order in which elements are added to a set is not preserved.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Unique Elements: </span>
                        <ul>
                            Sets ensure that no duplicate elements are allowed. If you attempt to add a duplicate element to a set, it won't be added.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Mutable (editable): </span>
                        <ul>
                            Sets are mutable, which means you can add and remove elements from a set.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h5>Creating Sets:</h5>

            <p>
                You can create sets in Python by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of elements within curly braces or by using the `set()` constructor. <br>
                Here's how to create a set:
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Or using the `set()` constructor:</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h5>Accessing Set Elements:</h5>

            <p>
                Sets are unordered collections, so you cannot access elements by their indices as you can with lists or tuples. 
                You typically work with sets by testing for membership or iterating through their elements.
            </p>

                        To avoid the error, you can use the `discard()` method.</li>

                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            my_set.remove(3)  # Removes the element 3 from the set
                            my_set.discard(7)  # Removes the element 7 if it exists in the set

                        <ul>
                            Dictionary keys are unique, meaning each key can only appear once in a dictionary.
                        </ul>

                    <li><span>Heterogeneous Values: </span>
                        <ul>
                            Dictionary values can be of different data types, including integers, strings, lists, other dictionaries, and more.
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            Dictionaries are mutable, which means you can add, update, or remove key-value pairs.
                        </ul>

            <h3>Creating Dictionaries:</h3>

            <p>
                You can create dictionaries in Python by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of key-value pairs within curly braces. 
                Each key is separated from its corresponding value by a colon. <br>Here's how to create a dictionary:
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h3>Accessing Dictionary Elements:</h3>
        
            <p>You can access values in a dictionary using their keys. <br>Here's how to access values by key:</p>

            <pre>
                <code>
                    name = my_dict['name']  # Access the value associated with the key 'name'
                    age = my_dict['age']  # Access the value associated with the key 'age'
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h3>Common Dictionary Operations:</h3>

                    <li><span class="dic-ol-li">Removing Key-Value Pairs: </span>You can remove key-value pairs using the `del` statement or the `pop()` method.</li>

                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            del my_dict['city']  # Removes the key-value pair with the key 'city'

            </div>

            <div class="dic-op">
                Python's dictionaries are kind of hash-table type. They work like associative arrays or 
                hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any 
                Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any 
                arbitrary Python object. <br>
                Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed 
                using square braces ([]). For example-

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        #!/usr/bin/python3
                        dict = {}
                        dict['one'] = "This is one"
                        dict[2] = "This is two"
                        tinydict = {'name': 'john','code':6734, 'dept': 'sales'}

                        print (dict['one']) # Prints value for 'one' key
                        print (dict[2]) # Prints value for 2 key
                        print (tinydict) # Prints complete dictionary
                        print (tinydict.keys()) # Prints all the keys
                        print (tinydict.values()) # Prints all the values
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p id="mini-txt">This produces the following result :</p>

                <pre class="output-result">
                    This is one
                    This is two
                    {'dept': 'sales', 'code': 6734, 'name': 'john'}
                    ['dept', 'code', 'name']
                    ['sales', 6734, 'john']
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Dictionaries have no concept of order among the elements. It is incorrect to say that the 
                    elements are "out of order"; they are simply unordered.

                In summary, dictionaries in Python are used to store and manage data in key-value pairs. <br>
                They are versatile and efficient for tasks that involve looking up values based on keys, 
                such as representing properties of objects, storing configuration settings, and organizing data in various data processing tasks. <br>
                Understanding how to work with dictionaries is essential for many Python programming scenarios.
